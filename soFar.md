Welcome to sonGrade!

This web application will allow you to rate your favorite (or least favorite)
songs on a scale of 0 to 100.

On the Home Page are two tables: the "Top Rated Songs" and the "Worst Rated
Songs". These tables display the top 10 highest rated songs and top 10 worst
rated songs, respectively.

If the user wishes to rate a song, they simply click the Rate A Song button
in the navbar at the top of the page. Similarly, if the user wishes to search
for a song to rate, they can click the search button at the top right of the
page.

Once the user is in the search page (reached by clicking "Rate A Song" or the
search button), they can enter a song title and an artist, then submit.
Submission will take the user to a page that confirms that they chose the
correct song, allowing them to quit if they made a mistake, or proceed
to the Quick Rate page.

On the Quick Rate page, there is a sliding range form, which allows the user
to rate the song they chose from 0 to 100. The user can rate the song as 0,
10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100. Upon submission, the rating is
entered into a database of all song entries, and if the rating puts the song
into the top 10 best or worst rated songs, it will appear on the homepage.
